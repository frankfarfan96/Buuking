# Booking Replica

In this project I made a replica of the Booking site, copying some parts of its
interfaces and implementing some of its functions. The 3 interfaces that I made were the
homepage, the Search results after selecting the search button
and the page after having selected one of the "searched" hotels. It is a static site and it is not responsive,
is a simple project in order to continue practicing handling React, Redux, React-Router-Dom and other
more library that also implements I mean Calendar.
